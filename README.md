This repository is a place where post tutorials, blogs and sometimes video walkthroughs for people interested in Kubernetes. I am fairly new to the Kubernetes landscape but I have enjoyed diving into everything and want to have a place where I can dump my knowledge in the hopes of helping someone get started with their own journey through the landscape.

## Tutorials
- [Cluster Setup](docs/cluster-setup.md)
- [Cluster Monitoring Setup](docs/cluster-monitoring-setup.md)
- [Pihole Setup](docs/pihole-setup.md)

## Learning
If your looking for place to start in terms of learning Kubernetes and the principals that spawned kubernetes in the first place, look no further than here.
